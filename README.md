# Redux Toolkit Todo App

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Todo application using Redux Toolkit, a powerful package for simplifying Redux logic and reducing boilerplate code.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following components and features:

- **Components**:
  - `AddTodo.jsx`: Allows users to add new Todo items.
  - `Todos.jsx`: Displays the list of Todo items.

- **Features**:
  - `todoSlice.js`: Defines Redux slice with reducers for adding and removing Todo items.

## How Redux Toolkit Simplifies State Management

### 1. Boilerplate Reduction
Redux Toolkit significantly reduces boilerplate code by providing simplified APIs for creating actions, reducers, and store configuration.

### 2. Immutable Updates
State updates are immutable by default in Redux Toolkit, ensuring predictability and preventing common bugs associated with mutable state.

### 3. Built-in Immutability
Redux Toolkit leverages Immer internally, enabling developers to write simpler reducer logic that directly mutates state.

### 4. Enhanced Developer Experience
Redux Toolkit's APIs are designed to improve the developer experience, making it easier to understand, write, and maintain Redux code.

### 5. Debugging Tools
Redux Toolkit includes built-in middleware for development purposes, providing powerful debugging capabilities such as time-travel debugging with Redux DevTools Extension.
